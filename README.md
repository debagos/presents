# Presents
This mod adds some simple, but colorful presents to your game.

To have crafting recipes, you need the `default` and `dye` mod (both are in `minetest_game`).

This mod has an **optional_depends** on the `unified_inventory` mod, which is only to detect if there's already a crafting recipe existent for a present. If that's the case, you'll see a warning in your log, telling you what item has the same ingredient assembly.
